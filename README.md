====================

This package is a skeleton for IRC services in Python that allow
creation of any kind of service you might want to write on your own, with the
annoying IRC parsing done for you.

Currently only supports shadowircd+ac (shadowircd). If you want to include another
protocol, writing a 3rd party module is easy.

A webfrontend is a long term goal, using Django, because it comes with an
administrator interface!
